# Quaternary-periodic-complementary-pairs

Periodic complementary pairs are arrays whose periodic autocorrelation sums to a delta function.
We proposed a method to construct such pairs from special arrays called the perfect quaternion arrays. 
For more information on the construction, please refer to [1].

This repository contains a program to construct periodic complementary pairs (PCPs) using perfect quaternion arrays (PQAs). 
If you use this program, please cite [1]. Note that our procedure can be used to transform any PQA to a PCP. The PQAs used in this example are from [2].
